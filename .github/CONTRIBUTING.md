# contributing to tildemush

`tildemush` is an amibitious project started by a single person. While there's been an attempt to capture lots of things in issues and documentation, there remains a lot of nebulous project planning that exists in [@vilmibm](https://github.com/vilmibm)'s head.

This means that contributing can be a little confusing :( If you'd like to help out with `tildemush` and it's not clear how, your help is definitely still wanted! Comment on [#22](https://github.com/vilmibm/tildemush/issues/22) and we'll figure out the best way to contribute.

# golden rule

ASK FIRST! The last thing I want is to reject a big PR because it was written without knowledge of some already in development feature. Hopefully, this project will reach a state where enough people are managing issues that there's no up-front activity required before contributing. Until then, though, let's chat :)
